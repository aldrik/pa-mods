## Server

### Masquerade

Disguises players during the match.

- Commanders are hidden in lobby, you can only select a faction.
- Colours are hidden in lobby (high contrast colours are randomly assigned).
- During the match chat messages and the player list is anonymised.


## Client

### UI Tweaks

Removes the control groups bar & the need to scroll the selections box.

Before: ![](http://i.cubeupload.com/jROT7r.png)

After: ![](http://i.cubeupload.com/Gk7hR6.png)

Also includes minor fixes:

- System Editor's incorrect placement of hotkey messages and build bars when logged in.
- Uberbar being one pixel scrollable when a chat exists.


### Expanded Hotkeys

Extends the vanilla hotkeys system a little:

- *Enables adding immediate/prioritised build queues (control key by default).*
- Case insensativ build bar items (allow holding shift).
- *Modeless/click-free commands (hold for area commands).*
- Clear build queue(s) while allowing already started units to finish.
- Filter selection by unit type.
- Select all idle fabricators.
- Toggle chronocam (jumps back in time with rapid consecutive key presses).
- Also removes the annoying prompt when deleting units & structures.

Also includes the following game fixes:
- Makes the ammo group accessible.
- [Stops the issue with double pressing recall command groups][alphaBug].
- [Fixes zooming from the celestial view][4025].

### Fabricator commander
Adds the commander to the fabricator grouping, so it's included in idle alerts and fabricator selecting.

### Don't Look at me!

Stops the camera from moving over and zooming on the commander when spawning. Also stops the automatic creation of the camera anchor and control group.


### Continuous build stance

If a selection consists of only idle factories, set them to continuous build stance.


### Relative zoom speed

Adjusts the zoom speed relative to the planet radius.
